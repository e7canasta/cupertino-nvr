# [RESEARCH] Adaptive ROI Detection & Dynamic Zones

**Priority**: P2  
**Effort**: 2 story points (spike)  
**Epic**: Phase 3 - Intelligence  
**Labels**: research, roi, computer-vision, ml  

## Problem Statement

Current system processes entire video frames uniformly. For efficiency and accuracy:
- Focus inference on regions of interest (ROI)
- Adapt ROI based on activity patterns
- Reduce computational load on static areas
- Improve detection accuracy in active zones

## Research Questions

1. **ROI Detection Methods:**
   - Motion-based ROI using background subtraction?
   - ML-based activity detection for zone identification?
   - Manual zone configuration vs automatic discovery?

2. **Adaptive Algorithms:**
   - How to dynamically adjust ROI based on activity history?
   - Balancing computational savings vs detection accuracy?
   - Optimal update frequency for ROI adjustments?

3. **Integration Challenges:**
   - How to integrate with existing InferencePipeline?
   - Performance impact of ROI preprocessing?
   - Maintaining detection quality in edge cases?

## Spike Objectives

- [ ] Research existing ROI detection libraries and methods
- [ ] Prototype motion-based ROI detection  
- [ ] Measure performance impact (CPU, accuracy)
- [ ] Test with various video scenarios (static, dynamic, mixed)
- [ ] Evaluate integration complexity with current architecture
- [ ] Document findings and recommendations

## Technical Exploration

**Libraries to Evaluate:**
- OpenCV background subtraction (MOG2, KNN)
- YOLO-based activity detection
- Optical flow for motion tracking
- Custom CNN for zone classification

**Prototype Architecture:**
```python
class AdaptiveROIProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.roi_detector = MotionBasedROI()
        self.activity_history = ActivityTracker()
    
    def process_frame(self, frame):
        # 1. Detect current activity zones
        active_zones = self.roi_detector.detect(frame)
        
        # 2. Update historical patterns  
        self.activity_history.update(active_zones)
        
        # 3. Generate optimized ROI
        roi = self.activity_history.get_adaptive_roi()
        
        # 4. Crop frame to ROI for inference
        return self.crop_to_roi(frame, roi)
```

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: 20%+ reduction in inference time
- **Accuracy**: <5% drop in detection recall
