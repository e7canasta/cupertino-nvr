# [BUG] Pipeline Pause/Resume Instability

**Priority**: P1  
**Effort**: 2 story points  
**Epic**: Phase 2 - Scale & Performance  
**Labels**: bug, stability, pipeline  
**Reporter**: Development Team  
**Date**: 2025-01-25  

## Problem Description

Pipeline pause/resume functionality shows instability issues:
- Occasional hangs during pause operation
- Resource leaks after multiple pause/resume cycles  
- Inconsistent state after resume
- Thread synchronization issues

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Start processor with multiple streams
2. Send pause command via MQTT
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Send resume command via MQTT  
5. Repeat steps 2-4 multiple times
6. Monitor resource usage and thread counts

## Expected Behavior

- Pause should cleanly stop processing and release resources
- Resume should restore full functionality
- Multiple pause/resume cycles should be stable
- No resource leaks or thread accumulation

## Actual Behavior

- Occasional timeout during pause (>30s)
- Memory usage increases after each cycle
- Some streams fail to resume properly
- Background threads may not terminate cleanly

## Environment

- **OS**: Linux Ubuntu 22.04
- **Python**: 3.11.x
- **Streams**: 4-8 concurrent RTSP streams
- **Model**: YOLOv8x-640

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on investigation in `PAUSE_FIX_SUMMARY.md`:
- InferencePipeline.terminate() may not fully clean resources
- Thread coordination issues in ControlPlane
- Possible race conditions in MQTT command processing

## Proposed Solution

1. **Enhanced Resource Cleanup:**
   ```python
   def _cleanup_pipeline(self):
       """Enhanced cleanup with timeout and force termination"""
       if self.pipeline:
           try:
               self.pipeline.terminate(timeout=10)
           except TimeoutError:
               logger.warning("Pipeline termination timeout, forcing cleanup")
               self._force_cleanup()
   ```

2. **Thread Safety Improvements:**
   - Add proper synchronization primitives
   - Implement graceful shutdown with timeouts
   - Add resource monitoring and leak detection

3. **State Management:**
   - Clear state tracking during pause/resume
   - Validate pipeline health before operations
   - Add recovery mechanisms for failed operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 100+ pause/resume cycles complete without issues
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable across cycles
- [ ] All streams resume successfully after pause
- [ ] Pause operation completes within 5 seconds
- [ ] Resume operation completes within 3 seconds
- [ ] No background thread leaks detected
- [ ] Resource cleanup verified with monitoring

## Testing Strategy

1. **Load Testing**: Automated pause/resume cycles
2. **Resource Monitoring**: Memory and thread tracking  
3. **Stress Testing**: Multiple concurrent operations
4. **Edge Cases**: Network interruptions, system load

## Priority Justification

This affects production stability and could cause:
- Service degradation over time
- Memory exhaustion on long-running instances
- Operational difficulties in production
