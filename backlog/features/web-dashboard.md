# [FEATURE] Web Dashboard & Management UI

**Priority**: P1  
**Effort**: 8 story points  
**Epic**: Phase 4 - Enterprise  
**Labels**: web-ui, dashboard, management  

## Problem Statement

Currently, NVR management is done via CLI and MQTT commands. For production deployments, operators need a visual interface to:
- Monitor multiple processor instances
- View real-time metrics and alerts
- Manage model configurations
- Access historical performance data

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Web-based dashboard accessible via browser
- [ ] Real-time processor status and metrics display
- [ ] Model management interface (switch, configure)
- [ ] Stream monitoring with thumbnails/previews
- [ ] Alert notifications and status indicators
- [ ] Historical metrics charts and trends
- [ ] Multi-user access with basic authentication
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile access

## Technical Notes

**Technology Stack:**
- FastAPI backend with WebSocket support
- React/Vue.js frontend with real-time updates
- Chart.js or D3.js for metrics visualization
- MQTT client in backend for event subscription

**Architecture:**
```
Web Browser → FastAPI → MQTT Broker → Processors
     ↑           ↓
   WebSocket   Event Store
```

**Dependencies:**
- Event storage system (see technical-debt/event-persistence.md)
- Authentication service
- WebSocket gateway

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Basic dashboard with processor status
2. **Phase 2**: Real-time metrics and charts  
3. **Phase 3**: Model management interface
4. **Phase 4**: Historical data and analytics

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Dashboard deployed and accessible
- [ ] Real-time updates working via WebSocket
- [ ] All core management functions available
- [ ] Performance tested with 10+ concurrent users
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] User documentation created
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness validated
