# [FEATURE] Multi-Node Orchestration & Load Balancing

**Priority**: P1  
**Effort**: 5 story points  
**Epic**: Phase 2 - Scale & Performance  
**Labels**: orchestration, scaling, load-balancing  

## Problem Statement

Current implementation supports multiple processors on single node. For production scale, need:
- Processor distribution across multiple nodes/servers
- Intelligent load balancing based on resource usage
- Fault tolerance with automatic failover
- Centralized orchestration of distributed instances

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Deploy processors across multiple physical nodes
- [ ] Automatic load distribution based on CPU/memory usage
- [ ] Node health monitoring and failure detection
- [ ] Automatic processor migration on node failure
- [ ] Stream assignment optimization for network efficiency
- [ ] Central orchestrator service for multi-node coordination
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment of processor updates
- [ ] Resource reservation and capacity planning

## Technical Notes

**Architecture Pattern:**
```
Control Plane (Master)
├── Node Manager 1 → Processor A, B, C
├── Node Manager 2 → Processor D, E, F  
└── Node Manager 3 → Processor G, H, I
```

**Components Needed:**
- Node Manager service per physical node
- Central Orchestrator service
- Service Discovery (Consul/etcd)
- Load Balancer (HAProxy/nginx)
- Health Check system

**MQTT Topics:**
- `nvr/nodes/{node_id}/status` - Node health
- `nvr/orchestration/assign` - Stream assignments
- `nvr/orchestration/migrate` - Processor migration

## Dependencies

- Container orchestration (Docker/Kubernetes)
- Service mesh or load balancer
- Distributed configuration management
- Node monitoring and metrics collection

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Multi-node deployment working with 3+ nodes
- [ ] Load balancing distributes streams efficiently
- [ ] Node failure handled with <30s recovery time
- [ ] Zero-downtime processor migration working
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard shows node health
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved vs single-node
- [ ] Documentation for multi-node deployment
